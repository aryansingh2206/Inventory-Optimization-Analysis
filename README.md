This project delivers a full-scale analytical breakdown of supplier performance and inventory trends to enhance profitability, pricing strategies, and stock planning.
Working with more than **10 million rows of procurement and supplier data**, the analysis highlights top and underperforming suppliers, evaluates margin performance, and uncovers strategic opportunities to boost business outcomes.

### **Project Overview**

The analysis begins with detailed exploratory work across multiple raw datasets. Using **MySQL**, all relevant tables were merged into a unified summary dataset containing essential metrics for further processing. The data underwent comprehensive cleaning, including type corrections, handling missing fields, and filtering out extreme outliers to ensure accurate insights. The refined dataset was stored for ongoing reporting and analytics.

Suppliers were segmented into **top-selling (top 25%)** and **low-selling (bottom 25%)** tiers based on total sales volume. Weighted mean margins and **95% confidence intervals** were computed to compare profitability across segments. Statistical testing revealed significant margin differences, with lower-selling suppliers offering higher per-unit profitability.

Additional analyses covered correlation matrices, freight cost patterns, and anomaly detection. Supporting visuals include bar graphs with confidence intervals, distribution plots, boxplots, KDE visualizations, and heatmaps.

### **Key Business Impact**

* **Revenue Strategy:** Top suppliers generate ~75% of sales, while low-selling suppliers add ~15–20% revenue with better margins—ideal for focused promotion.
* **Profitability Growth:** Targeting high-margin suppliers could lift overall profit by **5–8%**.
* **Cost Reduction:** Logistics and freight analysis indicates potential savings of **3–5%**.
* **Inventory Efficiency:** Identifies inventory velocity trends, improving stock allocation and reducing excess inventory costs.

### **Recommendations**

To maximize outcomes:

* Prioritize promotion of high-margin, low-volume suppliers to boost profit contribution.
* Revisit pricing strategies or cost structures for top-volume suppliers to retain revenue while improving profitability.
* Optimize logistics workflows to reduce freight costs by **3–5%**.
* Closely track slow-moving inventory to avoid overstock and reduce holding costs.
* Assess consistently underperforming suppliers for renegotiation or replacement.

---

### **Summary of Actions**

* Promote high-margin, low-volume suppliers
* Adjust pricing & cost structures for top-selling suppliers
* Reduce logistics expenditure
* Improve stock planning for slow movers
* Reevaluate low-impact suppliers
